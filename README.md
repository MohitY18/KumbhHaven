This project, KumbhHaven, is a web application for managing vacation listings and reviews. It allows users to sign up, log in (using Passport.js for authentication), browse listings, view details, add new listings (including image uploads via Cloudinary/Multer), edit/delete their own listings and reviews, and leave reviews on others' listings. Data is stored in a MongoDB database using Mongoose models.
